A utility library design to flush out usage of non thread safe glibc functions
which should be replaced by using the _r versions of the function.

This tool can either be run with LD_PRELOAD or be linked to the program at compile time.

For example

BREAKR_MODE=0 LD_PRELOAD=libbreakr.so ./app

Where BREAKR_MODE is setup as the following.

0 = Disable
1 = LOG to stderr
2 = LOG to syslog
3 = ABORT
